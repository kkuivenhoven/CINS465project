1. Suppose somebody requests the page "/polls/34"
	- mysite.urls Python module is loaded by Djano since it's ponted to by the ROOT_URLCONF setting
	- then finds urlpatterns variable and goes through the regular expressions in order
	- then it finds the matching url at '^polls/', strips/removes the matching text (i.e. "polls/") and sends the remaining text "34/" to the polls.urls URLconf for further processing
	- once there, it matches r'^(?P<question_id>[0-9]+)/$' resulting in a call to the detail() view like: 
		detail(request=<HttpRequest object>, question_id='34')
			- question_id='34' part comes from (?P<question_id>[0-9]+)
			- the ?P<question_id> defines the name that is to be used to identify the matched pattern
			- [0-9]+ is a reg. expression to match a seq. of digits (i.e. a number)
